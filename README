# TurnToPassage.Transformer

<img src="FrontEnd/src/deploy/package/shortcut-128.png" alt="TurnToPassage logo" title="TurnToPassage.Transformer" align="right" />

TurnToPassage.Transformers transforms any published Twine story into an EPUB file (though lacking any scripted Twine
logic) for reading on a eReader.

## Supported Twine Features

The following common Twine features are currently supported (or planned, marked with *):

* Markdown Syntax
* Standard Links (e.g. [[displayed text|title of passage]], [[passage title]])

## Usage

### Graphical User Interface

By far the easiest way to get starting is to use the GUI to do the work for you. Just download the right version for
your operating system and follow the instructions on the screen!

Operating System  | Download
----------------- | -------------
Windows           | [ttp-transform-0.0.1.zip](#)
Mac OS            | [ttp-transform-0.0.1.dmg](#)
Linux             | [ttp-transform-0.0.1.jar](#)
Other             | [ttp-transform-0.0.1.jar](#)

### Commandline

There is also a separate command-line version that works like this:

```
usage: java -jar ttp-transformer-0.0.1.jar [-help | -version] [-f <file>] [-o <file>]
 -f,--file <file>     location of input HTML file
 -help                display this help and exit
 -o,--output <file>   location of output EPUB file
 -version             output version information and exit
```

```
java -jar ttp-transformer-0.0.1.jar -f "My Cool Story.html" -o "My Cool Story.epub"
```

## Roadmap

The following features are to be expected next in roughly the following order:

<dl>
  <dt>Metadata</dt>
  <dd>Add the ability to set any metadata from inside a private Twine passage.</dd>
  <dt>Annotation tag</dt>
  <dd>Passages tagged with "annotation" will not be included in the EPUB file.</dd>
  <dt>Images</dt>
  <dd>Add the ability to add (local and remote) images to a Twine story. Images will be downloaded or copied to the EPUB
  file.</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Add the ability to add (local) stylesheets. Stylesheets will be copied to the EPUB file and included in the XHTML
  files.</dd>
  <dt>External Links</dt>
  <dd>Links to external websites.</dd>
  <dt>Scripting? and other EPUB3 features</dt>
  <dd>I currently do not own an eReader that supports EPUB3 features. But support for EPUB3 features, especially
  scripting could prove interesting.</dd>
